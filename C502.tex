\begin{abstract}
In an era where astronomical data is expanding at an unprecedented rate, the importance of data sharing and accessibility among astronomy archives cannot be overstated. 
Since the 1990s, an international partnership between the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI), the European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC), 
and the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre (CADC) has been focused on this endeavor, facilitating the exchange of data from the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes.

We will present how this collaboration has evolved over time, highlighting key milestones and innovations in decision-making, communication, and technology. 
Additionally, we will discuss some of the challenges we have encountered and the strategies we employed to overcome them, offering insights that could benefit future archive collaborations.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

Brief overview of each of the archives

\section{Collaboration History}

Brief section on the history of our collaboration

Originally shared all public HST data between archives
With the start of “On-the-Fly-Calibration”, moved to only sharing raw data and each archive would run their own pipeline
Instrument-team level collaboration for building products, addressing issues
Divided tasks to build Hubble Legacy Archive (HLA)
STScI: ACS and NICMOS imaging
CADC: WFPC2
ST-ECF and ESA: ACS and NICMOS grism data through 2010. 
Ran into some issues:
Which reduction is best? How to cite? How to reproduce results?
It became harder to keep pipeline processing in sync
Decision to consolidate creation of data products to STScI
Partner Data Centers would become data mirrors
HST Partner Consolidated Pipeline Project  (completed Oct 2017)

\section{Consolidated Pipeline Project}


STScI runs pipelines to reduce HST & JWST observations
Common Archive Observation Model (CAOM) to handle metadata format
CADC and ESAC harvest metadata and public data for these missions
Synchronized roughly every hour
ESAC provides access to proprietary data through their interface via a redirect back to STScI

\subsection{Tools}

The Common Archive Observation Model (CAOM)
Developed by CADC for astronomical observations across the EM spectrum
Not yet a VO standard, but IVOA working draft available
Groups multiple files into an “Observation”
Standardizes elements across missions, such as calibration levels, filter info, footprints, etc.
Extensible with supplementary information, eg instrument keywords, target keywords
https://github.com/opencadc/CAOM/

The Metadata & File Harvesters
Developed by CADC, with contributions from ESAC
Open Source tools at https://github.com/opencadc 
Installed at CADC and ESAC
List and get metadata and files from a CAOM service
Flexible to adapt to the different needs (e.g. folders to store the files)

\subsection{Communication}

Validating each other’s archives

Slack channel for asynchronous communication and discussions
Bi-weekly standups to check on status and go over issues
Annual Archives Coordination Meeting (ACM)
STScI hosts an Outerspace for common documentation

\section{Lessons Learned}

Agree on standards to use
Agreement to use Common Archive Observation Model (CAOM)
Metadata serialized in xml file for ease of transfer
Discussions on best way to translate mission data into CAOM
Table Access Protocol (TAP) to check status across archives
Communicate expectations
Agree to mirror only public data (eg, no proprietary/exclusive access data)
Timelines, data volume, ingest rates
Share tools and resources
CAOM was developed by CADC and integrated into STScI’s pipeline
Same harvester software is used by CADC and ESAC
STScI exploring how to use the harvester (for internal testing)

Have established check-ins
Biweekly standups with core team to ensure we are on track
Yearly meeting with a broader group to highlight status and work towards future goals
Have a robust testing infrastructure
Python and Java validation tools for CAOM content
Each archive checks metadata independently, but can also do cross-archive checks
Have Test databases with sample HST, JWST content
Working to produce dashboards for quick verification of results
Document the process
Systems and staff change over time
Capture how things work to make it easier to make changes in the future and train new staff
Enable future collaborations
Trust and confidence built on top of the collaboration


\section{The Template}
To fill in this template, make sure that you read and follow the ASPCS Instructions for Authors and Editors available for download online. Further hints and tips for including graphics, tables, citations, and other formatting helps are available there. With this template, you should have received a copy of the specific ADASS manuscript instructions, and you should also read these.

\subsection{The Author Checklist}
The following checklist should be followed when writing a submission to a conference proceedings to be published by the ASP for ADASS. The references are to sections in the ADASS manuscript instructions.\footnote{Most URLs should be in a footnote like this one.  In this case, you can download the online material from \url{http://www.adass.org}.} 

\begin{itemize}
\checklistitemize

\item References must all use BibTeX entries in a .bib file. No use of \verb"\bibitem"! (Even though some older ASP templates have them.) (See References.)
\item All references must be cited in the text, usually using \verb"\citet" or \verb"\citep".  Do not use \verb"\cite". (See References.)
\item No LaTeX warnings. Particularly, no overfull hboxes or unresolved references. (See LaTeX warnings and errors.)
\item No use of \verb"\usepackage" except for \verb"\usepackage{asp2014}". (See LaTeX packages and commands.)
\item No use of \verb"\renewcommand" or \verb"\renewenvironment". (See LaTeX packages and commands.)
\item Arguments to \verb"\citep" etc., should use ADS type references where possible, fall back on <author><year> or something suitably unique if not. (See References.)
\item References in the text are all generated automatically (using \verb"\citep" etc), not put in explicitly as ordinary text that just looks like a generated reference. (See References.)
\item Definitely no LaTeX errors. (See LaTeX warnings and errors.)
\item Paper is the right length. References don't spill over into one more page. (See Length of Paper.)
\item Paper has an abstract. (See Length of Paper.)
\item References are to things that actually exist and can be expected to continue to exist. Not papers ``in preparation'' or URLs for blog items. (See References.)
\item Graphics files have to be .eps encapsulated Postscript format. Yes they do! Sorry, but they do. (See Figures.)
\item Name all the files properly:- figures are <paper>\_f<n>.eps, eg O1-3\_f1.eps. Paper names use dashes not periods, O1-3.tex not O1.3.tex. Posters now use the same naming convention as oral papers, e.g.\ X3-21. (See File names and Paper IDs.)
\item Figure captions should make sense if the figure is printed in monochrome - because it will be! (See Figures.)
\item Figures are legible at the size ADASS Proceedings volumes are printed, which is quite small. (See Figures.)
\item Copyright forms signed and filled out - don't use electronic signatures. (See Miscellany.)
\item Author lists follow the correct format: comma separated, with an `and' for the final author. (See Authors and Affiliations.)
\item The first author of the paper must be the person who presented the paper at the conference. (See Authors and Affiliations.)
\item No repetition of affiliations - list each organisation once, with multiple e-mail addresses if you really must. (See Authors and Affiliations.)
\item Running heads should fit in the same horizontal space as the text does, not pushing the page numbers over to the right. (See LaTeX warnings and errors.)
\item Run through a spelling checker. (I know that can be tricky with LaTeX.) (See Content and Typesetting.)
\item Proofread, or have the text proofread, to check for proper English usage. In particular, note that ``allows to'' is not conventional English, and English uses articles (`a',`an',`the') in places where other languages, particularly Eastern European languages, don't have them. (See Content and Typesetting.)
\end{itemize}

\section{Text}
Sometimes you just need to have different styles of fonts.  \emph{Sometimes you just need to have different styles of fonts.} \textbf{Sometimes you just need to have different styles of fonts.}

Sometimes you just need to have different sizes of fonts.  {\small Sometimes you just need to have different sizes of fonts.} {\footnotesize Sometimes you just need to have different sizes of fonts.}  It would be very rare to require larger fonts within an ASP volume.

Do \emph{not} reduce the size of the main text font to try to squeeze more content into the paper. It will be restored by the editors and the paper will be rejected as too long.

\section{Math}
Sometimes authors include formulas inside the main text which should always be enclosed within \$ signs.  Look at the Pythagorean Formula $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

Sometimes authors include formulas on their own lines.  This example uses the \verb"displaymath" environment which does not include an equation number.  To include an equation number, use the \verb"equation" environment.
\begin{displaymath}
c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \qquad \textrm{Pythagorean Theorem}
\end{displaymath}

\section{Table}
Here is an example table that has three colums with various justification and row spacing.

\begin{table}[!ht]
\caption{Tables in \LaTeXe}
\smallskip
\begin{center}
{\small
\begin{tabular}{llc}  % l = left, c = centered
\tableline
\noalign{\smallskip}
First Column & Second Column & Third Column:\\
\noalign{\smallskip}
\tableline
\noalign{\smallskip}
First Row, First Column & First Row, Second Column & First Row, Third Column \\
Second Row, First Column & Second Row, Second Column & Second Row, Third Column \\
Third Row, First Column & Third Row, Second Column & Third Row, Third Column \\
\noalign{\smallskip}
\tableline % Sometimes you just need a line between table rows
\noalign{\smallskip}
Fourth Row, First Column & ~ & Fourth Row, Third Column \\ % Sometimes you have empty cells
\noalign{\smallskip} % Sometimes you just need space between table rows
Fifth Row First Column & Fifth Row, Second Column & Fifth Row, Third Column\\ % No \\ if the last row
\noalign{\smallskip}
\tableline\
\end{tabular}
}
\end{center}
\end{table}
\noindent These tables can get a little messy, but this format is the most common.

\section{Lists}
\label{ex_lists}
There are a lot of ways to make lists including itemized lists with bullets, for which you use  (\verb"\begin{itemize}"), numbered lists (\verb"\begin{enumerate}"), and description lists (\verb"\begin{description}").  This is an example of an itemized list.

\subsection{Itemized Lists}
Here is an itemized list:
\begin{itemize}
\item Item 1
\item Item 2
\item Item 3
\end{itemize}


\section{Images}
For some figures, see Figures \ref{ex_fig1}- \ref{ex_fig3}.

\articlefigure{C502_f1.eps}{ex_fig1}{Welcome to 1953.}
% It is possible to reduce the size of a figure among other changes (see the instructions).  Here is an example:
% \articlefigure[width=.5\textwidth]{example.eps}{ex_fig1_reduced}{Welcome to 1953 a little smaller.}

\articlefiguretwo{C502_f1.eps}{C502_f1.eps}{ex_fig2}{Now there are two of them.  \emph{Left:} An image from long ago.  \emph{Right:} The same exact thing.}
% There is a figure command allowing for three figures:
% \articlefigurethree{example.eps}{example.eps}{example.eps}{ex_fig1_triple}{Now there are three of them.}

\articlefigurefour{C502_f1.eps}{C502_f1.eps}{C502_f1.eps}{C502_f1.eps}{ex_fig3}{Now four of them?}

\clearpage % To force this stuff to happen by this point in the text, otherwise these will probably end up after the references.

There are also the landscape versions \verb"\articlelandscapefigure" and \\
\verb"\articlelandscapefiguretwo" which are further described in the instructions.

\section{References}
References must be provided in BibTeX format, in a .bib file, and should usually be referenced using \verb"\citet" or \verb"\citep". The file example.bib supplied with this template is taken from an ADASS 2015 paper, and includes references to previous ADASS proceedings 
\citep[such as][]{1999ASPC..172..487P} and to papers in what was then the current 2015 proceedings (e.g.\ \citet{O11-4_adassxxv}). Note that the `TBD' entries that appear for papers in the current proceedings will be dealt with by the ADASS editors when the final volume is produced. The example .bib file has a large number of references unused by this template file; such unused references have been left in as an example, but should be removed before a paper is submitted.

\section{Conference Photographs}

At the end of this template you may find a commented line with the bookpartphoto where the editors could decided to add a conference photo,
might there be enough room at the end of your paper. Leave this comment in, do not supply your own photos in this paper but contact the editors
if you have some interesting shots.

\acknowledgements The ASP would like to thank the dedicated researchers who are publishing with the ASP.  It will make things a lot easier if you keep this text on the same line as the \verb"\acknowledgements" command. Place it just before the bibliography. It's optional of course.


\bibliography{C502}  % For BibTex

% if we have space left, we might add a conference photograph here. Leave commented for now.
